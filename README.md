## Usage

The Webhallen Product Search app allows users to search for products available on Webhallen. Users can enter a product name in the search bar and view a paginated list of product results, including an image, description, and a link to view the product on Webhallen.

### How it Works:

2. **Results:** Results are fetched from Google's Custom Search API and displayed in a responsive grid.
3. **Pagination:** Users can navigate through search results with pagination controls.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** Adapts to various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) using Material-UI's Grid system.

- **Caching:** Search results are cached in localStorage for faster access during subsequent searches, saving API calls and improving user experience.

## API Integration

### Google Custom Search API
This application integrates with Google's Custom Search API, which is used to fetch product data from Webhallen. The application makes API calls to fetch the product information based on the user query.

### Rate Limiting
The Google Custom Search API has a limit of 100 queries per day. To maximize usage, we cache the search results in localStorage and reduce redundant API calls.

### API Request Example:

```javascript
const response = await searchProducts(query, currentStartIndex);
```

## Responsive Design

This application is fully responsive and adapts to various screen sizes using Material-UIâ€™s Grid system. Here's how the grid layout behaves across different breakpoints:

- Extra-small screens (xs: 12): The grid item takes up the full width of the container (1 item per row).

- Small screens (sm: 6): The grid item takes up half the width of the container (2 items per row).

- Medium screens (md: 4): The grid item takes up one-third of the width of the container (3 items per row).

- Large screens (lg: 3): The grid item takes up one-quarter of the width of the container (4 items per row).

The grid automatically adjusts based on the screen size, ensuring that the layout is optimized for any device.
